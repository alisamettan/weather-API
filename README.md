# Weather API Service

This project demonstrates the development of a weather API service that communicates with the OpenWeatherMap API. The purpose of this service is to fetch and display weather information based on user input for country and city.

## Overview
The Weather API Service is designed to receive requests from users, process these requests, and fetch the necessary weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The service supports retrieving daily, weekly, and monthly weather forecasts.

## Features
- **Country and City-Based Weather Retrieval**: Users can input a country and city to get the current weather and forecasts.
- **Flexible Forecasts**: The service can provide daily, weekly, and monthly weather forecasts based on user preferences.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error handling ensures graceful degradation in case of issues with external API communication or invalid user inputs.
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation of input parameters to ensure data integrity and reliability.
